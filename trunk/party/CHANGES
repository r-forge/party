                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-1 (2006-09-07)

    o    mob() can't currently handle missing values,
         they are removed and a warning is given.

    o    add `methods' to Depends:


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-0 (2006-08-31)

    o    node_barplot() can now also draw stacked barplots.

    o    simplify handling of ordinal variables. It is now possible
         to have multiple (ordinal) response variables.

    o    some documentation updates

    o    fix problems with NA handling for factors

    o    make sure minsplit criterion applies in the presence of missing
         values. Bug spotted by Han Lee <Han.Lee@geodecapital.com>.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-8 (2006-08-23)

    o    export `varimp' (variable importance measures for cforest())

    o    documentation updates

    o    add codetools checks


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-7 (2006-07-17)

    o    REAL(NULL) now gives an error in C code and scores could be 
         potentially NULL: fixed for the time being.

    o    add `show' method for BinaryTree and RandomForest objects


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-6 (2006-05-22)

    o    add some validity checks for hyper parameters

    o    add function `varimp' for computing variable importance
         measures for some random forests (this is still experimental and
         thus not exported yet, so use `party:::varimp')


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-5 (2006-04-25)

    o    all hyper parameters to `cforest' are now controlled using
         objects of a new class `ForestControl' which can be created using
         `cforest_control()'. 

    o    sampling of a fraction of the observations without replacement
         is now available for the `cforest' implementation of random forest.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-4 (2006-04-04)

    o    renamed argument `teststattype' to `teststat' with defaults
         c("quad", "max") in order to be compatible with the `coin' package, 
         version >= 0.4-5

    o    use `1 - (1 - p)^k' instead of `p * k' for Bonferroni-adjustment.
         Node 7 for the `GlaucomaM' data is now splitted in addition (in tms).


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-3 (2006-03-20)

    o   `predict' returned nonsensical results in case a tree was 
        fitted to a multivariate response variable. Now a list with one
        element for each observation is returned.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-2 (2006-03-01)

    o    plotting buglets fixed: improved axis in MOB plots,
         correct (transparent) background on jpeg() and png() devices.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-1 (2006-02-23)

    o    `testtype' can be Bonferroni, MonteCarlo, Univariate and
         Teststatistic (instead of Raw)		

    o    removed unnecessary constraint on weights in `cforest'

    o    maximize raw test statistics for random forest by default.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-0 (2006-02-15)		

    o    `cforest', an implementation of Breiman's random forest ensemble
         algorithm based on conditional inference trees (`ctree') has been
	 added. It is somewhat experimental and thus for advanced users only.

    o    `mob', an object-oriented implementation of a recently suggested
         algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis, Hothorn,
	 Hornik, 2005) has been added. It works out of the box for partitioning
	 (generalized) linear regression models, others can be easily plugged
	 in. A new vignette "MOB" describes the implementation ideas and provides
	 a few examples.

    o    new S3 generic reweight() with methods for (g)linearModel
         for re-fitting a model with different weights.

    o    new argument `maxdepth' to `ctree_control' which allows for
         growing trees of a fixed maximum depth.

    o    LazyData: yes
    

		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-6 (2006-02-06)

    o    use a different way to deal with NAMESPACEs during in tests/*.R
         following a suggestion by Prof. Brian D. Ripley

    o    use LazyLoad: yes instead of SaveImage: yes


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-5 (2006-02-02)

    o    make R CMD check happy and move src/README to inst/README


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-4 (2006-01-18)

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-3 (2006-01-18)

    o    some new convenience functions, not exported


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-2 (2006-01-12)

    o    isequal must not check equality of attributes


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-1 (2005-12-02)

    o    fix bug introduced in version 0.3-0: coin:::factor_trafo applies
         treatment contrasts in case of a binary factor but we need the full
         design matrix

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-0 (2005-11-29)

    o    `ytrafo' and `xtrafo' functions make use of `coin:::trafo' now,
         i.e. the handling of influence functions and transformations
         has been unified in packages `party' and `coin'


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-10 (2005-11-08)

    o    new slot `data' in BinaryTree objects, slots inputnames and levels 
         have been removed


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-9 (2005-10-19)

    o    splits in categorical variables could have failed due 
         to weired internal checks


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-8 (2005-08-06)

    o    fix problems reported by codetools


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-7 (2005-08-31)

    o    extract inputs using menv@get("input", data = newdata) in predict


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-6 (2005-08-29)

    o   make gfortran happy


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-5 (2005-08-19)

    o    ctree() now searches the global environment for variables given
         in `formula' when the `data' argument is unspecified.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-4 (2005-07-07)

    o    names of `criterion' element in `SplittingNode' objects were wrong

    o    categorical splits with `ctree_control(testtype = "MonteCarlo")'
         were potentially wrong


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-3 (2005-06-29)

    o   print and plot only levels which are available in a node (for nominal
        splits)


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-2 (2005-06-27)

    o   ./src/Makedeps will be automatically generated (on Windows)
        and must not be part of the source-package.

    o   vignette cosmetics
