Subject: Blocking factors in ctree of party

Dear Prof. Torsten Hothorn,

I am undertaking a classical ANOVA-like study with 
univariate continuous response variable and 
several explanatory variables (both quantitative 
and qualitative). I am enthusiastic about the 
party package for both the graphical visualization 
of results and the robustness and flexibility of 
the analysis by means of permutation tests.

Nevertheless, I have a problem in my context of 
analysis. I have, indeed, a blocking factor, that 
is, a controllable nuisance factor. The typical 
way to face this in ANOVA through the lm method is 
to include the factor in the model formula but to 
"ignore" its results in the table. With ctree the 
problem is that branching is applied also to this 
variable resulting in a confusing tree. Is it 
possible to include the factor in the analysis 
that is carried out, but to forbid branching on 
it? (Possibly with a sort of negated surrogate 
branching?)

If this was possible, would then be correct in the 
analysis framework of ctree to  treat both cases 
with unreplicated and replicated data within each 
experimental unit? (Due to my experience on 
permutation tests, permutations of results should 
occur only within the levels of the blocking 
factors and not between, but I do not know the 
permutation framework by Strasser and Weber that 
you are using).

Thank you in advance for any hint you may provide.

Best regards,
Marco
