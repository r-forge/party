p. 3, `F-ratio' -> `F ratio'

p. 4, `partition based' -> `partition-based'

p. 5, line 5: is it possible to avoid the line break between \in and
       A^\star?

p. 6, number (3.2): can the number be centered vertically in order to
       make clear that both \mu and \Sigma are numbered with (3.2)?

p. 7, FIXME: Bonferroni-adjusted P values $m P_j$ is not really true (anymore?)

p. 7, line -13: Monte Carlo procedures can _always_ be used

p. 7, line -5: `a asymptotic' -> `an asymptotic'

p. 9, line -3: the definition of w_i(\x) is missing. Please change to:
       ... an estimate can be obtained by 
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       \hat{\E}(\Y | \X = \x) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\x)\right)^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
       w_i(\x) \Y_i,
       \end{eqnarray*}
       where $w_i(\x) = w_i$ when $\x$ is element of the same terminal node as the
       $i$th observation and zero otherwise.

p. 11, why is the resolution (or graphic type) of Figure 1 and 3 different from
       Figure 2?

p. 11, caption Figure 1: `the fraction of glaucomateous eyes' -> `the fraction
       of glaucomateous and normal eyes, respectively,'

p. 11, line -5: The dataset is part (not: data is part)

p. 12, line 7: Schwarzer, not Schwarzen

p. 12, lines 5 and 9: please use logrank, not Logrank

p. 16, Table 2: missing period at end of caption.
