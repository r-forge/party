p. 5, line 5: is it possible to avoid the line break between \in and
    A^\star?

p. 6, number (3.2): can the number be centered vertically in order to
    make clear that both \mu and \Sigma are numbered with (3.2)?

p. 7, line -13: Monte Carlo procedures can _always_ be used

p. 9, line -3: the definition of w_i(\x) is missing. Please change to:

... an estimate can be obtained by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\E}(\Y | \X = \x) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\x)\right)^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n
w_i(\x) \Y_i,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $w_i(\x) = w_i$ when $\x$ is element of the same terminal node as the
$i$th observation and zero otherwise.
