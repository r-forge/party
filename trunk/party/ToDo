o       check GetRNGstate() and PutRNGstate() calls in C code

o       simplify handling of ordered factors, in a way similar to coin

o	we can re-compute prediction weights from the weights in the root
	node, the terminal node number and where.

o	more checks for MonteCarlo


o	check categorical splits more carefully (and add an example)


o	check `rforest' and convenience functions (`treepredict' seems the
        wrong name)
