o  milestones for 0.9-0:
   -  docu for mob (incl. journal + survreg)
   -  cite new TR
   -  vignette for cforest

o       check GetRNGstate() and PutRNGstate() calls in C code

o       simplify handling of ordered factors, in a way similar to coin

        -> simply use scores as transformations, what about splitting???

o	we can re-compute prediction weights from the weights in the root
	node, the terminal node number and where.

o	more checks for MonteCarlo

o	check categorical splits more carefully (and add an example)

o	check `cforest' and convenience functions (`treepredict' seems the
        wrong name)

o       allow missing values in factors
