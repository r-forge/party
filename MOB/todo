Benchmarking

  1. Base model: linear regression
     Data: Boston Housing
           medv ~ lstat + rm | zn + indus + chas + nox + age + dis + rad + tax + crim + b + ptratio
	   (minsplit = 40)
     Competitors: LM, CTree, RPart, M5', GUIDE
     Performance measure: MSE
     
  2. Base model: logistic regression
     Data: Pima Indians Diabetes
           diabetes ~ glucose | pregnant + pressure + triceps + insulin + mass + pedigree + age
     Competitors: GLM, CTree, RPart, J4.8, LMT, QUEST, (LOTUS?)
     Performance measure: misclassification, binomial deviance
     
  3. Base model: Weibull survival regression (Cox Proportional Hazards)
     Data: Melanom survival
     Competitors: [Survival regression (CoxPH), CTree, RPart]
     Performance measure: [Brier score]

Comparison via
  o table: average performance for each
  o figure: confidence intervals all vs. MOB (see Fig.5 in Benchmarking paper)
  o explorative analysis of tree size (number of nodes)


Survival regression
  o survReg statmodel based on survreg() plus S3 methods
  o CoxPH statmodel based on coxph() plus S3 methods
  o scatterplot variant that visualizes censoring (pch = 1 vs = 19?)
